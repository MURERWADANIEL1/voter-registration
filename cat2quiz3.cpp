/*The Interim Independent Electoral Commission (IIEC) of Kenya requires an Electronic Voting Management System (EVMS) through which new voters can be added, invalid voters deleted as well as displaying of a voter�s details, among other functions.

Voter details include voter card ID, National ID Number, First Name, middle name, surname, polling station, date of birth (entered in dd-mm-yyyy format) and  gender .

In an interview for  an advertised Software Developer position, the commission has requested you to demonstrate with a simple program how a voter details can be added and displayed.  Using your own defined and appropriate voter class and an interactive driver program (i.e. main function) write a C++ program to achieve this.*/
